I'm going through this exercise to further my own learning. I'm sharing it in case it can help someone else, as I have benefited greatly from other's postings. As you read this, you will assuredly find many opportunities for improvements. Please share them with me!\n\n---\n\n## Contents\n\n1. [Background](#Background)\n1. [Approach](#Approach)\n1.

[Conclusions](#Conclusions)\n\n---\n\n\n## Approach\n\nThe exercise we will try to perform on SageMaker is making a submisssion to the \"House Prices\" Kaggle competition:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques\n\nOur goal is _not_ to score highly on the leaderboard. We just want to use the SageMake infrastructure to arrive at a solution that is somehow better than a naive solution. As such, many corners will be cut: default algorithms will be used, data exploration will be mostly skipped, feature engineering won't be much of a concern. And because there is a ton of information and notebooks available on the Kaggle site about this competition, we won't repeat them here. So refer to the Kaggle site for background information.\n\nBecause random forest algorithms can perform reasonably well on this type of regression problem, we'll use a eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) SageMaker example as seed notebook. That'll help us so we don't have to hunt for the right syntax and such. You can find that notebook on the SageMaker examples tab or on GitHub if you don't want to use this notebook: https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/introduction_to_applying_machine_learning/xgboost_direct_marketing/xgboost_direct_marketing_sagemaker.ipynb\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Environment\n\n### AWS Setup\n1. First, we need an AWS account on aws.amazon.com\n1. Once signed in, locate the SageMaker service: https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home?region=us-east-1#/landing\n1. Then hit \"Create notebook instance\". Since this EC2 instance will only be used to run the Jupyter notebook, it does not need to be particularly powerful. I chose the default of \"ml.t2.medium\" which costs 5 cents/hour at the time of this writing. I used the default, permissive IAM role because... cutting a straight line to Sagemaker.\n1.

The pros urge us to do the following:\n\n> Cleaning up data is part of nearly every machine learning project.  It arguably presents the biggest risk if done incorrectly and is one of the more subjective aspects in the process.  Several common techniques include:\n\n>* Handling missing values: Some machine learning algorithms are capable of handling missing values, but most would rather not.  Options include:\n * Removing observations with missing values: This works well if only a very small fraction of observations have incomplete information.\n * Removing features with missing values: This works well if there are a small number of features which have a large number of missing values.\n * Imputing missing values: Entire [books](https://www.amazon.com/Flexible-Imputation-Missing-Interdisciplinary-Statistics/dp/1439868247) have been written on this topic, but common choices are replacing the missing value with the mode or mean of that column's non-missing values.\n* Converting categorical to numeric: The most common method is one hot encoding, which for each feature maps every distinct value of that column to its own feature which takes a value of 1 when the categorical feature is equal to that value, and 0 otherwise.\n* Oddly distributed data: Although for non-linear models like Gradient Boosted Trees, this has very limited implications, parametric models like regression can produce wildly inaccurate estimates when fed highly skewed data.  In some cases, simply taking the natural log of the features is sufficient to produce more normally distributed data.  In others, bucketing values into discrete ranges is helpful.  These buckets can then be treated as categorical variables and included in the model when one hot encoded.\n* Handling more complicated data types: Mainpulating images, text, or data at varying grains is left for other notebook templates.\n\n> Luckily, some of these aspects have already been handled for us, and the algorithm we are showcasing tends to do well at handling sparse or oddly distributed data.  Therefore, let's keep pre-processing simple.\n\nSo, for the purpose of racing to the end, we'll disregard most of it and simply convert categorical variables to numerical data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"40f242973360a35041c57c8ffeb5e45b7c865335"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train = pd.get_dummies(df_train)   # Convert categorical variables to sets of indicators\ndf_train.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0ab66615d72f348165ae1e4d9cd4293e004c5b88"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Feature engineering\n\nIf we cared about the score, we would totally look into that."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"446a8545ba25750cac699efdc6a98e1c7a8c5e2b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We, however, will heed this advice regarding creating a validation test from our test data:\n\n> When building a model whose primary goal is to predict a target value on new data, it is important to understand overfitting.  Supervised learning models are designed to minimize error between their predictions of the target value and actuals, in the data they are given.  This last part is key, as frequently in their quest for greater accuracy, machine learning models bias themselves toward picking up on minor idiosyncrasies within the data they are shown.  These idiosyncrasies then don't repeat themselves in subsequent data, meaning those predictions can actually be made less accurate, at the expense of more accurate predictions in the training phase.\n\n> The most common way of preventing this is to build models with the concept that a model shouldn't only be judged on its fit to the data it was trained on, but also on \"new\" data.  There are several different ways of operationalizing this, holdout validation, cross-validation, leave-one-out validation, etc.  For our purposes, we'll simply randomly split the data into 3 uneven groups.

Before we do that, one thing to note is there are algorithm settings which are called \"hyperparameters\" that can dramtically affect the performance of the trained models. For example, XGBoost algorithm has dozens of hyperparameters and we need to pick the right values for those hyperparameters in order to achieve the desired model training results. Since which hyperparameter setting can lead to the best result depends on the dataset as well, it is almost impossible to pick the best hyperparameter setting without searching for it, and a good search algorithm can search for the best hyperparameter setting in an automated and effective way.\n\n>We will use SageMaker hyperparameter tuning to automate the searching process effectively. Specifically, we specify a range, or a list of possible values in the case of categorical hyperparameters, for each of the hyperparameter that we plan to tune. SageMaker hyperparameter tuning will automatically launch multiple training jobs with different hyperparameter settings, evaluate results of those training jobs based on a predefined \"objective metric\", and select the hyperparameter settings for future attempts based on previous results. For each hyperparameter tuning job, we will give it a budget (max number of training jobs) and it will complete once that many training jobs have been executed.\n\n>Now we configure the hyperparameter tuning job by defining a JSON object that specifies following information:\n* The ranges of hyperparameters we want to tune\n* Number of training jobs to run in total and how many training jobs should be run simultaneously. More parallel jobs will finish tuning sooner, but may sacrifice accuracy. We recommend you set the parallel jobs value to less than 10% of the total number of training jobs (we'll set it higher just for this example to keep it short).\n* The objective metric that will be used to evaluate training results, in this example, we select *validation:auc* to be the objective metric and the goal is to maximize the value throughout the hyperparameter tuning process. One thing to note is the objective metric has to be among the metrics that are emitted by the algorithm during training. In this example, the built-in XGBoost algorithm emits a bunch of metrics and *validation:auc* is one of them. If you bring your own algorithm to SageMaker, then you need to make sure whatever objective metric you select, your algorithm actually emits it.\n\n>We will tune four hyperparameters in this examples:\n* *eta*: Step size shrinkage used in updates to prevent overfitting. After each boosting step, you can directly get the weights of new features. The eta parameter actually shrinks the feature weights to make the boosting process more conservative. \n* *alpha*: L1 regularization term on weights. Increasing this value makes models more conservative. \n* *min_child_weight*: Minimum sum of instance weight (hessian) needed in a child. If the tree partition step results in a leaf node with the sum of instance weight less than min_child_weight, the building process gives up further partitioning. In linear regression models, this simply corresponds to a minimum number of instances needed in each node. The larger the algorithm, the more conservative it is. \n* *max_depth*: Maximum depth of a tree. Increasing this value makes the model more complex and likely to be overfitted. \n\nNote that I have no idea if these are the correct parameters to tune, nor if their ranges are appropriate. Once again, we don't care so much at the moment as we are just trying to make the end-to-end process work. We have our baseline result above to ensure we don't end up with worse results."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"b7c84380bfa46c06fcdbc2369eb43f70a41a8979"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from time import gmtime, strftime, sleep\ntuning_job_name = 'xgboost-tuningjob-' + strftime(\"%d-%H-%M-%S\", gmtime())\n\nprint (tuning_job_name)\n\ntuning_job_config = {\n    \"ParameterRanges\": {\n      \"CategoricalParameterRanges\": [],\n      \"ContinuousParameterRanges\": [\n        {\n          \"MaxValue\": \"1\",\n          \"MinValue\": \"0\",\n          \"Name\": \"eta\",\n        },\n        {\n          \"MaxValue\": \"10\",\n          \"MinValue\": \"1\",\n          \"Name\": \"min_child_weight\",\n        },\n        {\n          \"MaxValue\": \"2\",\n          \"MinValue\": \"0\",\n          \"Name\": \"alpha\",            \n        }\n      ],\n      \"IntegerParameterRanges\": [\n        {\n          \"MaxValue\": \"10\",\n          \"MinValue\": \"1\",\n          \"Name\": \"max_depth\",\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"ResourceLimits\": {\n      \"MaxNumberOfTrainingJobs\": 20,\n      \"MaxParallelTrainingJobs\": 3\n    },\n    \"Strategy\": \"Bayesian\",\n    \"HyperParameterTuningJobObjective\": {\n      \"MetricName\": \"validation:rmse\",\n      \"Type\": \"Minimize\"\n    }\n  }","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"286646c4172e38af20014c24177729c3716d43e3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":">Then we configure the training jobs the hyperparameter tuning job will launch by defining a JSON object that specifies following information:\n* The container image for the algorithm (XGBoost)\n* The input configuration for the training and validation data\n* Configuration for the output of the algorithm\n* The values of any algorithm hyperparameters that are not tuned in the tuning job (StaticHyperparameters)\n* The type and number of instances to use for the training jobs\n* The stopping condition for the training jobs\n\n>Again, since we are using built-in XGBoost algorithm here, it emits two predefined metrics: *validation:auc* and *train:auc*, and we elected to monitor *validation_auc* as you can see above.

Three minutes is long enough for my mind to wander. It is likely that I could be more skilled at creating the intances once and leaving them running.
